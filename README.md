# Week 2 Code Challenge
#### Date: 29/March/2024

#### Author: *Brian Omondi*

## Description  
The project builds three functions to perfom different tasks. They are as follows:
1. A function that accepts a string as input and swaps the case of each character. For example if you input 'The Quick Brown Fox' the output should be 'tHE qUICK bROWN fOX'

2. A JavaScript function that accepts two numbers to generate an array between them. For example, if the two numbers are 4 and 7, the output should be [4, 5, 6, 7] and -4 and 7 should return [-4, -3, -2, -1, 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7]

3. A function that takes an array of numbers as input and returns a new array containing only the prime numbers from the original array. It accurately identifies prime numbers and returns them in the same order they appear in the input array. For example if you provide an array [1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10] it returns an array [2, 3, 5, 7].
